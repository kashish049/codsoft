# 🚀 CodSoft Internship - C++ Projects

Welcome to my CodSoft Internship Projects repository! This repo includes 3 C++ console-based applications built as part of my internship assignments to strengthen my programming fundamentals.

## 📁 Project List

### ✅ Task 1: Number Guessing Game
A simple console-based game where:
- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user tries to guess the number.
- Hints are provided: "Too High", "Too Low", until the correct guess.
- Number of attempts is tracked.

📂 File: `Number_Guessing_Game.cpp`  
🛠 Concepts Used: Loops, Conditionals, Random Number Generation

### ✅ Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that features:
- 3x3 grid representation
- Players take turns as 'X' and 'O'
- Real-time win/draw detection
- Option to play again

📂 File: `Tic_Tac_Toe_Game.cpp`  
🛠 Concepts Used: Arrays, Conditionals, Game Logic, Functions

### ✅ Task 3: To-Do List Manager
A console-based task manager that allows:
- Adding tasks
- Viewing tasks with status (Pending ✅ / Completed ⏳)
- Marking tasks as complete
- Removing tasks

📂 File: `To_Do_List.cpp`  
🛠 Concepts Used: Structs, Vectors, Menus, Input Validation
